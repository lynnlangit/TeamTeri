## Summary Table: Common Types of Genomic Sequencing

| Sequencing Type         | Description                                                                 | Common Uses                        | Reference |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------|
| Sanger Sequencing      | First-generation, chain-termination method.                                  | Small-scale sequencing, validation | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanger_sequencing) |
| Next-Generation (NGS)  | High-throughput, parallel sequencing technologies.                          | Whole genome, exome, transcriptome | [Illumina](https://www.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/beginners.html) |
| RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq)| Sequencing of RNA to study gene expression.                                 | Transcriptomics, gene expression   | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq) |
| Single-Cell Sequencing | Sequencing at the single-cell level for cellular heterogeneity.              | Cancer, immunology, development    | [Nature Review](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm.2016.127) |
| Long-Read Sequencing   | Technologies like PacBio and Oxford Nanopore for longer DNA fragments.       | Structural variation, complex regions | [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/smrt-science/smrt-sequencing/) |
| Whole Genome Sequencing| Sequencing the entire genome of an organism.                                 | Population genomics, diagnostics   | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_genome_sequencing) |
| Targeted Sequencing    | Sequencing specific regions of interest (e.g., panels, exomes).              | Disease gene panels, diagnostics   | [Illumina](https://www.illumina.com/techniques/sequencing/dna-sequencing/targeted-resequencing/targeted-panels.html) |
