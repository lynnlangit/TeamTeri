The Nextflow platform architecture is shown in the slide above.  [Seqera](https://seqera.io/) is a commercial company comprised of the core Nextflow committer team.

## About the Nextflow platform 
NF is built by Seqera Labs. NF pipelines can run on AWS, Azure, GCP and other environments

## Seqera and Nextflow

Seqera Labs plays a pivotal role in the development and support of the Nextflow platform. As the creators of Nextflow, Seqera is deeply committed to open-source development and actively contributes to the Nextflow community. Their expertise ensures that Nextflow remains at the forefront of workflow orchestration, enabling researchers and developers to build, run, and share data-driven analysis pipelines across a wide range of computing environments.

For more information about Seqera and their contributions to the Nextflow project, visit [Seqera's website](https://seqera.io/).

## Example Pipeline

Nextflow allows you to build, configure and run data-driven computational pipelines, an example is shown below.  Nextflow enables scalable and reproducible scientific workflows using software containers. The example diagram is for the [nf-core/eager](https://nf-co.re/eager) pipeline. This pipeline is a scalable and reproducible bioinformatics best-practise processing pipeline for genomic NGS sequencing data, with a focus on ancient DNA (aDNA) data. It is ideal for the (palaeo)genomic analysis of humans, animals, plants, microbes and even microbiomes
